= File Upload =

Demonstrates selecting a file and sending it using HTML forms.

== Design ==

The File Upload example is designed to demonstrate the file select dialog provided by the platform, and handling & sending a file using HTML forms over the network.

The example has two simple views, one for starting the file upload flow, and another for selecting the file and sending it.

For more information on File upload design, see the

==== File Upload help text: ====
File upload requires people to select the file to be uploaded (via an API). After that, people return to the upload view and confirm the upload process. Uploading is done by the browser. After upload completion, the application returns to the originating page.

== Implementation ==

The example code snippet below defines the whole File Upload example mini app's structure. Basically it consists of a simple HTML <form> with two <inputs>, one with type=file, which will provide the button to open the file select dialog, and another with type=submit, which upon clicked will send the form to the given action handler.

Please note, that the horizontal aligning of the elements is usually done with tables in S40 Web Apps, as the CSS "float" style formatting isn't supported.
